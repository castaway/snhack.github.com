Or possibly a Hackspace Open Day?

On the 15th and 22nd of March the Museum of Computing took part in the National Science and Engineering Week, entitled "Step into the Future". Members of the hackspace were asked to pitch in  with our 3D Printers, to demo to the public and generally answer questions. It was also an opportunity to make more people aware of the hackspace and what we do.

On the first Saturday, Rob was there running the Hackspace Prusa printer, Jess and James brought their monster Shapercube and ran it on the other side of the table. We scattered around a bunch of Steve's 3D printed wares to fill the rest of the table, which were useful so people to poke at while waiting to peer into the printers.

It went pretty well.Â Quite a few people looking round and asking questions, a fair bit of interest was generated from the kids club, both the children and their parents.

The hackspace 3D printer mostly behaved itself apart from the annoying heater issues we seem to have and at one point it seemed the y-axis was sticking again. It managed to print a little wheel, a hackspace logo, a letter A designed by one of the kids club kids, a letter L for another one of them, a small train for a little boy who _really_ liked trains, and a mini tardis and a little fox pendant for a couple of the museum volunteers.

The shapercube printed various bits, mostly small items so that people could watch from start to finish. We ended up with several small board game figures, a J&J logo (donated to a fascinated lady), and a set of [tablet-stand parts](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:37283). The hackspace printer is utterly silent compared to the shapercube beast :-) 

People in general were very impressed with the selection of prints supplied by Steve that we laid out on the table.

On the 2nd Saturday Steve and Rob took the stand with the hackspace printer and Steve's printer. Thw day was even busier than the first Saturday, or so I hear.

Several people took away hackspace leaflets, and we've even had some extra visitors.
