The `title` field can differ from that used in the filename. This allows changing the
title later without breaking existing links, or use of a longer title than that used in
the post's URL.

<!-- more -->

The `updated` field can be used to note the most recent date of any significant changes.
The newer date will be shown in the post footer, but will not change the index.

    subtitle:   One of many articles with the same title
    date:       2012-01-04 18:12
