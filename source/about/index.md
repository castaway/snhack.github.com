The Swindon [Hackspace] formed in June 2012, holding [weekly meetings](#weekly-meetings)
for those interested in making, breaking, and fixing things. We are a new hackspace,
looking to build membership and grow [our toolkit].

[Hackspace]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace
[our toolkit]: {{ site.github_wiki }}/Tools-and-consumables
[projects]: {{ site.github_wiki }}/Hackspace-Projects

Members work on a range of [projects] that usually involve electronic hardware, software
programming, and mechanical assembly. Popular projects often include prototyping
electronic circuits using breadboard, and interfacing with [Arduino], [Raspberry Pi] or
[Stellaris LaunchPad] microcontrollers.

Members occasionally run informal sessions on topics such as [PICAXE], Laser Cutting,
[OpenSCAD], and 3D Printing. If you have an idea for a session you would like to run,
please let us know via the [group] or on twitter [@snhack].

### Weekly Meetings

The Swindon Hackspace meets weekly at the [Museum of Computing], near the Wyvern Theatre
([view map]).

Sessions start at 6.30pm each Wednesday, and it's advisable to arrive no later than
7.15pm. We usually finish between 9.30 and 10pm.

Session price is £4 and paid on admission. Membership is paid annually in advance
and costs £10 (waived until third visit for new members, due each July thereafter).

Internet access is available via WiFi and Ethernet, we also have computers available if
required.
