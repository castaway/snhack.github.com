Paragraphs of text are separated with a blank line. Lines within a paragraph will be
merged, which allows the plain text to be hard wrapped for readability.

End a line with two spaces,  
if you must force a line break.

Here's a [link to github](http://github.com "This title is optional"), some text with
*italic* and **bold** formatting, and an image:

![Github's Octocat](https://github.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png "Optional title")

<!-- more -->

Note: to simply make a plain text URL clickable, enclose it in angle brackets:
<http://github.com>.


## Block Elements

- This is
- an unordered list
    1. with an ordered
    2. list embedded
- you can **use markdown** here
- done


> And this is a block quote, you can **use markdown** here too!


To include code samples:

    Indent with 1 tab or 4 spaces to *prevent* conversion by markdown
    Code such as HTML can shown without being interpreted: <!-- comment -->

Short phrases of code can be marked up inline, by wrapping with the `back tick character`.

---

Add a horizontal rule `<hr>` by adding three or more dashes or asterisks.


## Reference Links

You can use [reference style links][twitter] to keep things tidy.

[twitter]: http://twitter.com

References can be used [multiple times][twitter], by both links and images.

If the reference is the same as the linked text, you don't need to repeat it.

Link to the [octocat][] shown below:
