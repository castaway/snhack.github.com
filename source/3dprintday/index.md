The Swindon Hackspace usually hides away in the basement of the
[Museum of Computing]. Sometimes we bring our toys out to play and let
the general public have a go.

3D print days are days when we are upstairs in the museum on a day
when the museum is open. We will have computers and instruction sheets
for getting started with designing 3D objects. 3D printers will be
available to allow you to have your 3D designs printed.
