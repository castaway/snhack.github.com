### Contributing a Post without using Git

_Lowest barrier to entry, only requires a github account._

If you've not used `git` before (and don't want to [learn]), you can submit a simple post
using github's issues feature.

Create a [new issue] with your metadata and content formatted using [markdown]. Here's a
[template] and some [examples]. The issue editor allows you to add images and preview the
rendered markdown.

[new issue]: https://github.com/snhack/snhack.github.com/issues/new
[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus

[template]: https://raw.github.com/snhack/snhack.github.com/source/source/_posts/_examples/2012-01-01-template.md
[examples]: https://github.com/snhack/snhack.github.com/tree/source/source/_posts/_examples

[learn]: http://try.github.com/

You can view the progress of your new issue in its [discussion thread].
Notifications will normally be sent by email to those active or mentioned
in the thread, as well as those watching either the thread or the related repo.
